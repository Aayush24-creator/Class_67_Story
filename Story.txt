Introduction

 The Dream Palace King Krishnadevraya once dreamt of a beautiful palace hanging in the air, full of all kinds of luxuries
  & desired to own such a palace. Everyone realised the king's stupidity but none dared to tell him. So the ministers sought
 Tenali Rama's help to bring the king to his senses.

 One day an old man came to the king crying and complaining that the king had looted his wealth in his dreams. Annoyed at the old 
 man's words, the king said angrily, "Foolish man, how can a dream be a reality?". Hearing the king's words, Tenali Rama at once
  revealed his identity and said, "Your Majesty, that's what the matter is. Your dream palace can never be a reality too."
