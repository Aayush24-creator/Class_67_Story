Introduction
 The Dream Palace King Krishnadevraya once dreamt of a beautiful palace hanging in the air, full of all kinds of luxuries
  & desired to own such a palace. Everyone realised the king's stupidity but none dared to tell him. So the ministers sought
 Tenali Rama's help to bring the king to his senses.
