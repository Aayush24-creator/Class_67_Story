 The Dream Palace King Krishnadevraya once dreamt of a beautiful palace hanging in the air, full of all kinds of luxuries
  & desired to own such a palace. Everyone realised the king's stupidity but none dared to tell him. So the ministers sought
 Tenali Rama's help to bring the king to his senses.

 man's words, the king ordered the soldiers to return his wealth.
